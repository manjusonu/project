          Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
          From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The
          seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is
          ground into a powder and typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

          Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its
          caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and can be prepared and presented
          in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is
          usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are
          often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like
          doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to
          be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).

          Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in
          healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases,
          although some of the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.[5]

          The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the
          middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner
          similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.[2] The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian
          Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached
          the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.

          <strong>Coffea arabica </strong>(/əˈræbɪkə/), also known as the Arabian coffee, is a species of Coffea. It is
          believed to be
          the first species of coffee to be cultivated, and is currently the dominant cultivar, representing about 60%
          of global production.[2] Coffee produced from the (less acidic, more bitter, and more highly caffeinated)
          robusta bean (C. canephora) makes up most of the remaining coffee production. Arabica coffee originates from
          Ethiopia and was first cultivated in Yemen, and documented by the 12th century.[3][4] Coffea arabica is
          called ‏بُنّ‎ (būnn) in Arabic, borrowed from the Oromo "Buna".

      <h2> ROBUSTA COFFEE </h2><br>

      <strong> Robusta Coffee is a </strong>Coffea canephora (syn. Coffea robusta, commonly known as robusta coffee) is
      a species of coffee that has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is a species of flowering
      plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known as Coffea robusta, the plant is scientifically identified as
      Coffea canephora, which has two main varieties, robusta and nganda.[2]

      Coffea robusta represents 43% of global coffee production, with Coffea arabica constituting most of the remainder.
      There are several differences between the composition of coffee beans from C. arabica and C. robusta.[3][4] Beans
      from C. robusta tend to have lower acidity, more bitterness, and a more woody and less fruity flavor compared to
      C. arabica beans.

      <strong> Excelsa Coffee is a </strong> Excelsa coffee beans are cultivated in medium altitudes and possess
      “teardrop” shape, which proclaims it resemblance to Liberica. The Excelsa was recently acknowledged as the variety
      of Liberica. Water, sugar and coffee powder is required for brewing a cup of coffee.

      <h2> LIBERICA COFFEE </h2><br>

      <strong> Liberica Coffee is a </strong> Coffea liberica (or Liberian coffee) is a species of flowering plant in
      the family Rubiaceae from which coffee is produced. It is native to western and central Africa from Liberia to
      Uganda and Angola, and has become naturalised in the Philippines, Indonesia, Seychelles, the Andaman & Nicobar
      Islands, Malaysia [3][4]..

      Robusta is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known by the synonym Coffea
      robusta, the plant is currently scientifically identified as Coffea canephora, which has two main varieties, C. c.
      robusta and C. c. nganda.[2] The plant has a shallow root system and grows as a robust tree or shrub to about 10 m
      tall. It flowers irregularly, taking about 10–11 months for berries to ripen, producing oval-shaped beans.

      The robusta plant has a greater crop yield than that of arabica, contains more caffeine (2.7% compared to
      arabica's 1.5%),[5] and contains less sugar (3–7% compared to arabica's 6–9%).[6] As it is less susceptible to
      pests and disease,[7] robusta needs much less herbicide and pesticide than arabica.

      Native distribution
      C. canephora grows indigenously in Western and Central Africa from Liberia to Tanzania and south to Angola. It was
      not recognized as a species of Coffea until 1897,[8] over a hundred years after Coffea arabica.[9][5] It is also
      reportedly naturalized in Borneo, French Polynesia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles.[10] In
      1927 a hybrid between robusta and arabica was found in Timor. This strain was subsequently used to breed
      rust-resistant plants.[11]

      Cultivation and use

      Unroasted (so-called 'green') robusta beans

      Traditional coffee beans drying in Kalibaru, Indonesia
      Coffee made from beans of the Coffea canephora plant has low acidity and high bitterness, often with a distinct
      woody and nutty taste. C. canephora beans, widely known by the synonym Coffea robusta, are used primarily in
      instant coffee, espresso, and as a filler in ground coffee blends.

      Robusta has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa.[2] It is easy to care for, has a greater crop
      yield, has almost double the amount of caffeine and more antioxidants,[12] and is less susceptible to disease than
      arabica coffea.[11] It represents 43% of global coffee production, with arabica constituting the remainder except
      for the 1% constituted by coffea liberica[13]

      It is mostly grown in Vietnam, where French colonists introduced it in the late 19th century, though it is also
      grown in India, Africa and Brazil, where it is often called conilon.[14] In recent years, Vietnam, which produces
      mostly robusta, has become the world's largest exporter of robusta coffee, accounting for over 40% of the total
      production.[13] It surpasses Brazil (25% of the world's production), Indonesia (13%), India (5%), and Uganda
      (5%).[13] Brazil is still the biggest coffee producer in the world, producing one-third of the world's coffee,
      though 69% of that is C. arabica.[13]

      Since Robusta is easier to care for and has a greater crop yield than C. arabica, it is cheaper to produce.[15]
      Roasted robusta beans produce a strong, full-bodied coffee with a distinctive earthy flavour, but usually with
      more bitterness than arabica due to its pyrazine content.[16][17] Since arabica beans are believed to have
      smoother taste with more acidity and a richer flavour, they are often considered superior, while the harsher
      robusta beans are mostly used as a filler in lower-grade coffee blends.[15] However, the powerful flavour can be
      desirable in a blend to give it perceived "strength" and "finish", noticeably in Italian coffee culture.
      Good-quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends, at about 10–15%, to provide a
      full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known as crema). It is also used as a stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant,
      antipyretic and relieves spasmodic asthma.[citation needed][18][19]

      Wild plants grow between 9 and 12 m (30 and 39 ft) tall, and have an open branching system; the leaves are
      opposite, simple elliptic-ovate to oblong, 6–12 cm (2.5–4.5 in) long and 4–8 cm (1.5–3 in) broad, glossy dark
      green. The flowers are white, 10–15 mm in diameter and grow in axillary clusters. The seeds are contained in a
      drupe (commonly called a "cherry") 10–15 mm in diameter, maturing bright red to purple and typically contains two
      seeds, often called coffee beans.

      Distribution and habitat
      Endemic to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia,[8] Coffea arabica is now rare in Ethiopia, while many
      populations appear to be of mixed native and planted trees. It is commonly used as an understorey shrub. It has
      also been recovered from the Boma Plateau in South Sudan. Coffea arabica is also found on Mount Marsabit in
      northern Kenya, but it is unclear whether this is a truly native or naturalised occurrence; recent studies support
      it being naturalised.[9][1] The species is widely naturalised in areas outside its native land, in many parts of
      Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, China, and assorted islands in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.[10]

      The conservation of the genetic variation of C. arabica relies on conserving healthy populations of wild coffee in
      the Afromontane rainforests of Yemen. Genetic research has shown coffee cultivation is threatening the genetic
      integrity of wild coffee because it exposes wild genotypes to cultivars.[11] Nearly all of the coffee that has
      been cultivated over the past few centuries originated with just a handful of wild plants from Yemen, and today
      the coffee growing on plantations around the world contains less than 1% of the diversity contained in the wild in
      Yemen alone.[12]

      History
      Main article: History of coffee
      The first written record of coffee made from roasted coffee beans (botanical seeds) comes from Arab scholars, who
      wrote that it was useful in prolonging their working hours. The Arab innovation in Yemen of making a brew from
      roasted beans, spread first among the Egyptians and Turks, and later on found its way around the world. Other
      scholars believe that the coffee plant was introduced from Yemen, based on a Yemeni tradition that slips of both
      coffee and qat were planted at 'Udein' ('the two twigs') in Yemen in pre-Islamic times.[13] Arabica coffee
      production in Indonesia began in 1699 through the spread of Yemen's trade. Indonesian coffees, such as Sumatran
      and Java, are known for heavy body and low acidity. This makes them ideal for blending with the higher acidity
      coffees from Central America and East Africa.[8]

      Cultivation and use

      Botanical drawing of Coffea arabica, around 1860

      Botanical drawing of C. arabica, dating from around 1880.
      Coffea arabica accounts for 60% of the world's coffee production.[2]

      C. arabica takes approximately seven years to mature fully, and it does best with 1.0–1.5 metres (39–59 in) of
      rain, evenly distributed throughout the year.[citation needed] It is usually cultivated at an altitude between
      1,300 and 1,500 m (4,300 and 4,900 ft),[citation needed] but there are plantations that grow it as low as sea
      level and as high as 2,800 m (9,200 ft).[14]

      The plant can tolerate low temperatures, but not frost, and it does best with an average temperature between 15
      and 24 °C (59 and 75 °F).[15] Commercial cultivars mostly only grow to about 5 m, and are frequently trimmed as
      low as 2 m to facilitate harvesting. Unlike Coffea canephora, C. arabica prefers to be grown in light shade.[16]

      Two to four years after planting, C. arabica produces small, white, highly fragrant flowers. The sweet fragrance
      resembles the sweet smell of jasmine flowers. Flowers opening on sunny days result in the greatest numbers of
      berries. This can be problematic and deleterious, however, as coffee plants tend to produce too many berries; this
      can lead to an inferior harvest and even damage yield in the following years, as the plant will favor the ripening
      of berries to the detriment of its own health.

      On well-kept plantations, overflowering is prevented by pruning the tree. The flowers only last a few days,
      leaving behind only the thick, dark-green leaves. The berries then begin to appear. These are as dark green as the
      foliage, until they begin to ripen, at first to yellow and then light red and finally darkening to a glossy, deep
      red. At this point, they are called "cherries", which fruit they then resemble, and are ready for picking.

      The berries are oblong and about 1 cm long. Inferior coffee results from picking them too early or too late, so
      many are picked by hand to be able to better select them, as they do not all ripen at the same time. They are
      sometimes shaken off the tree onto mats, which means ripe and unripe berries are collected together.

      The trees are difficult to cultivate and each tree can produce from 0.5 to 5.0 kilograms (1.1 to 11.0 lb) of dried
      beans, depending on the tree's individual character and the climate that season. The most valuable part of this
      cash crop are the beans inside. Each berry holds two locules containing the beans. The coffee beans are actually
      two seeds within the fruit; sometimes, a third seed or one seed, a peaberry, grows in the fruit at tips of the
      branches. These seeds are covered in two membranes; the outer one is called the "parchment coat" and the inner one
      is called the "silver skin".

      On Java, trees are planted at all times of the year and are harvested year round. In parts of Brazil, however, the
      trees have a season and are harvested only in winter. The plants are vulnerable to damage in such poor growing
      conditions as cold or low pH soil, and they are also more vulnerable to pests than the C. robusta plant.[17]

      The coffee tree was first brought to Hawaii in 1813, and it began to be extensively grown by about 1850.[18] It
      was formerly more widely grown than at present, especially in Kona,[18] and it persists after cultivation in many
      areas. In some valleys, it is a highly invasive weed.[19] In the Udawattakele and Gannoruwa Forest Reserves near
      Kandy, Sri Lanka, coffee shrubs are also a problematic invasive species.[20]

      It is expected that a medium-term depletion of indigenous populations of C. arabica may occur, due to projected
      global warming, based on IPCC modelling.[21] Climate change—rising temperatures, longer droughts, and excessive
      rainfall—appears to threaten the sustainability of arabica coffee production, leading to attempts to breed new
      cultivars for the changing conditions.[22]

      Gourmet coffees are almost exclusively high-quality mild varieties of arabica coffee, and among the best known
      arabica coffee beans in the world are those from Jamaican Blue Mountain, Colombian Supremo, Tarrazú, Costa Rica,
      Guatemalan Antigua, and Ethiopian Sidamo.[23][24][25]

      Excelsa coffee ( Coffea liberica var. Dewevrei , syn .: Coffea excelsa A. Chev. , Coffea dewevrei De Wild. & T
      Durand ) is a type of coffee . The variety is considered a rarity and was discovered in 1904 on Lake Chad .

      The size of the beans is roughly the same as that of Robusta coffee , while the growth and leaves are similar to
      Coffea liberica . It has the strongest growth of all types of beans. Above all, the ability to thrive well on
      drier soil and to generate a satisfactory yield even in years with little rain is what distinguishes them. Today
      this variety is mainly grown in Chad and accounts for around 1% of world coffee production. Because of its
      scarcity and its strong aroma, Excelsa coffee is considered a rarity on the one hand, but takes getting used to on
      the other. [1] [2]

      Excelsa coffee is a variety of the kind Coffea liberica [3] [4] whose Nominatform (var. Liberica ) is referred to
      in English as Liberica coffee.
